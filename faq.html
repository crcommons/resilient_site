                    <h3>When will Resilient launch?</h3>
                    <p>Resilient is currently in development and hopes to launch by the end of 2015. </p>
                    <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
                    <p>Resilient is looking for 2 main types of people: those who can code and those who with business development experience. Resilient is in the early stages of developing a complex application to support its users. We’re also looking for those who can help make Resilient financially sustainable. As an early stage start-up, we’re doing things cheap. But we still have to pay the bills. If you’d like to support the development of Resilient, please donate! </p>
                    <h3>Is it safe and secure for users?</h3>
                    <p>Resilient takes security very seriously. I key component of our application is security so that any information in our database is secure. In addition, Resilient is setting up multiple mechanisms to ensure that users are not abused and can participate in a safe and open environment.</p>
                    <h3>Aren’t you worried about false reports in the system?</h3>
                    <p>That’s always a consideration. However, it is unlikely. Most statistics show that only 2% of sexual assault accusations are false. In Resilient’s case, multiple accusations would have to be made about the same person for the system to share that information with the accusers. Resilient will make every effort to ensure that users are not abusing the system for unintended purposes.</p>
                    <h3>How will common assailants be identified?</h3>
                    <p>Resilient is developing multiple mechanisms to compare user-entered data to identify matches. The first of those will be links to online profiles to cross-reference. Others will include comparing data provided by accusers. </p>
                    <h3>Can’t people abuse the system?</h3>
                    <p>There is always this risk when developing communities online. Resilient will take every opportunity to remind its users to take precaution when interacting with other users online. In addition, Resilient will work to keep abusers out of the application in the first place by verifying profile information before a user can join the community.</p>
